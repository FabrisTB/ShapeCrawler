# Testing
- Run tests `tests/ShapeCrawler.DevTests/ShapeCrawler.DevTests.csproj` to check the changes that you've made.
- Use only tests `tests/ShapeCrawler.DevTests/ShapeCrawler.DevTests.csproj`. Other tests are used for CI/CD.

# Code Style
- Use the code-style rules from `src/.editorconfig`.
- Use prefix `this` for the instance members of the class.
- Try to encapsulate something with class constructors and deal with it in its `internal`/`public` methods. Thus, such classes should not have `internal` and `public` static methods.
- Do object-oriented programming (OOP)
  - Do not create classes with `-er`, `-or`, `-service` suffixes.
  - Class names should be nouns, e.g. `Slide`, `Slides`.
  - Class should not have `public` or `internal` static members.
